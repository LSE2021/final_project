## The Big Idea
The project idea is to build a random color generator that can generate and display a random color palette of 5. If time allows, we are planning to also take input of either RGB code or a color name to return a color palette that matches the color. Through this project, we are able to learn how to convert between color names and RGB. 

## Learning Goals
Our team is interested in design and we have always wondered how to best complement colors. Through this project we will ease access to the best color palettes. In more technical terms, this project will teach us more about APIs and more specifically, Colormind (http://colormind.io/api-access/). We will learn how to create an app and how to use Heroku. This project will also foster HTML learning because we will have to create an initial page and a nicely-formatted result page with the color palette showing.

## Implementation Plan & Project Schedule
Our team has already identified the API which can give us random color palettes or take user input and return other colors that will match. Each palette has 5 colors. The API is the following: http://colormind.io/api/. 

We have 3 weeks from today. The next implementation phases and steps are outlined below: 
* First week of April: we will work on the python file so that we make sure that we read the data correctly and we access each RGB element in the dictionary returned.
* Second week of April: we will use Flask and work on the HTML code so that we can create a nice user-friendly interface.
* Third week of April: we will write down the project and we will learn how to publish the website using Heroku.
* Big day on Apr 26, 2022: Presentation in front of class.

## The collaboration plan 
We are going to figure out what functions we need together, and split up the functions. We will also inform each other when one is working on the script so that our works would not overlap, and if there is any problem one has run into the other could help with fresh eyes.
Then we are going to figure out the Flask and HTML together.

## Risks
One problem we can foresee is how to display the colors on the website. The json reponse is a dictionary with a list with nested list of RGB codes as value, so we are still figureing out how to link individual color to the block that will display on the result page.

## Additional Course Content
The usage of flask and of API are especially helpful for this project.
